# is_it_up

A testbed for deploying and monitoring clustered Elixir applications in Kubernetes - with Prometheus monitoring and Grafana metrics display.

## ex_bench supported

This project builds with [ex_bench](https://github.com/bryanhuntesl/ex_bench/) support

## TODO

* Servers to poll stored in database rather than single hard coded target (google.com)
* Add [eflame dependency](https://github.com/esl/eflame) to identify process bottlenecks
* Build using Erlang 22 with https://hub.docker.com/r/bryanhuntesl/alpine-erlang and [S.L. Fritchie eflame patch](https://github.com/bryanhuntesl/alpine-erlang/blob/experiment/slfritchie-eflame-enhancements/patches/slfritchie-eflame.patch)
